## Rap God

Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.  
But I'm only going to get this one chance.  
Something's wrong, I can feel it.  
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.  
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble.
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.
You are just what the doc ordered.

I'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god.  
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod.
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot so call me rap-bot.
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes.
I got a laptop in my back pocket, my pen'll go off when I half-cock it.  
Got a fat knot from that rap profit.  
Made a livin' and a killin' off it, ever since Bill Clinton was still in office,
with Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack.
I'm an MC still as honest but as rude and as indecent as all hell.
Syllables, kill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-pop.  
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match 
with this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack.
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherF table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half.

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact.
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs.  
Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad.
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack while I'm masterfully construsting this masterpiece.

Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god.  
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod.
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard.
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got.  
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's, simply rage and youthful exuberance.  
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance, hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)

MCs get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"  
Now I lead a new school full of students'
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim.
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position,
to meet Run-D.M.C, and induct them into the motherF' rock and
Roll Hall of Fame even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames.  
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame.
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames,
off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy so gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy.  
You're witnessin' a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy.
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"- That's all they say, lookin' boy.
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back and a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy.  
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy? I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy.  
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keepin' up with the same place. lookin' boy,

'cause-I'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god.
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod.'
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR,
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, The white trash God.
Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton-no, Asgard, Asgard.
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin.
You rodent, I'm omnipotent.
Let off, then I'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs I'm totin' and I should not be woken.
I'm the walkin' dead, But I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'.
But I got your mom deep-that thin'.
I'm out my Ramen Noodle, we have nothin' in common, poodle.
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil.
It's me, my honesty's brutal.
But it's honestly futile if I don't utiliza what I do though for good at least once in a while.
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes to
maybe try to help get some people through tough times.
But I gotta keep a few punchlinese just in case 'cause even you unsigned.
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I was king of underground.
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind.
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine.
Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line.
I said on "I'm back" from The Mathers LP when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine.
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47 a revolver and a nine.
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was,
but I'm morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal.
You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though, and I don't know what the F that you rhyme for.
You're pointless as Rapunzel with F cornrows. 
You're like normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future, just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad,
'cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad, 
singin' to a man while they played piano.
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel.
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day, "Hey Fab, I'mma kill you!" 
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed. (JJ Fad)
Uh, summa-lummma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human.
what I gotta do to get it through to you?
I'm superhuman innovative and I'm made of rubber, 
so that anything you saying ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you.
I'm devastatin' more than never demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating.
Never fading and I know that the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say I fell off they'd be celebrating.
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music.

"Oh he's too mainstream, well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it."
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"-'cause I found a hella way to fuse it.
With rock, shock rap with Doc throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it.
I don't know how to make songs like that, I don't know what words to use.
Let me know when it occurs to you, while I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you.
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you, how many verses I gotta murder to 
prove that if you're half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie, but look at the accolades the skills brung me.
Full of myself, but still hungry.
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to, and I'm a million leagues above you.
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you.
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel, I'ma sleep in the front seat, 
bumpin' Heavy D and the Boys still "chunky but funky", 
but in my head there's something, I can feel tugging and struggling.
Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me.
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had, then you may be a little patient and more symphatetic to the situation and understand the discrimation.
But fuck it life's handing you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women?
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad.
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king, Think not - why be a king when you can be a God.


## Lose Yourself
[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man



## Godzilla

Ugh, you're a monster. 

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla, better hit the deck like the card dealer.
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party across between a zombie apocalypse and big bobby "The Brain" heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania.


## I need a doctor

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
"Dre, don't leave us like that, man", 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
